2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

    O(n) - linear time complexity
   - **Hash Table**
    O(1) - constant time complexity
   - **Binary Search Trees** 
   O(logn) - logarithmic time complexity
2. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

1.  Not having to iterate over the entire hash table to find the desired value.

2. To add or remove items on an array you have to manipulate the entire array.  With a hash table, you can add and remove specific items without having to shift or manipulate the entire hash table.
